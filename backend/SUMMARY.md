# Micro-Entrepreneur Growth App - Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a comprehensive backend for the Micro-Entrepreneur Growth App using Python and FastAPI. The backend provides all the core features requested:

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Management
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Registration**: Secure user signup with password hashing
- **Profile Management**: CRUD operations for user profiles

### 2. Customer Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete customers
- **Search Functionality**: Search and filter customers by name
- **Customer Tracking**: Store customer details and interaction history

### 3. Referral System
- **Referral Tracking**: Manage customer referrals with status tracking
- **Reward System**: Track referral rewards and points

### 4. AI-Powered Assistant
- **Google Gemini Integration**: AI-powered advice for customer interactions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse with request limiting
- **Notification Scheduling**: Schedule follow-ups and reminders

### 5. Social Media Integration
- **Account Linking**: Connect to WhatsApp Business, Facebook, Instagram
- **Background Posting**: Schedule social media posts using Celery

### 6. Dashboard & Analytics
- **Metrics Display**: View total customers, referrals, and engagement rates
- **Reporting**: Generate activity reports

### 7. Security Features
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation for emails, phone numbers, and passwords
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse, especially on expensive AI endpoints
- **Security Headers**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Data Sanitization**: Prevention of XSS attacks

### 8. Background Task Processing
- **Celery Integration**: Asynchronous task processing for notifications and social media
- **Redis Backend**: For task queue management

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (easily scalable to PostgreSQL)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API
- **Background Tasks**: Celery with Redis
- **Security**: Passlib, Python-Jose, SlowAPI, Bleach
- **Testing**: Pytest
- **Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/signup` - Register new user
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `GET /auth/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /auth/profile` - Update user profile

### Customers
- `POST /customers/` - Create customer
- `GET /customers/` - List customers
- `GET /customers/search` - Search customers
- `GET /customers/{id}` - Get customer details
- `PUT /customers/{id}` - Update customer
- `DELETE /customers/{id}` - Delete customer

### Referrals
- `POST /referrals/` - Create referral
- `GET /referrals/` - List referrals
- `GET /referrals/rewards` - Track referral rewards
- `PUT /referrals/{id}` - Update referral

### Dashboard
- `GET /dashboard` - Fetch metrics
- `GET /reports` - View activity reports

### Social Media
- `POST /social/connect` - Link social accounts
- `GET /social/accounts` - List social accounts
- `POST /social/refresh/{id}` - Refresh tokens
- `POST /social/post/{user_id}/{platform}` - Schedule social post
- `DELETE /social/disconnect/{id}` - Disconnect account

### AI Assistant
- `POST /ai/ai-assist` - Get AI-powered advice (rate limited)
- `POST /ai/notifications` - Schedule notifications

## Deployment
The backend is fully containerized with Docker and includes a docker-compose configuration for easy deployment. Environment variables are used for configuration, making it easy to deploy in different environments.

## Security Measures
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Security headers to prevent common attacks
- Environment-based configuration for secrets

This backend implementation provides a solid foundation for the Micro-Entrepreneur Growth App, with all the requested features and proper security measures in place.
